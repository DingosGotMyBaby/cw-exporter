# CodeWalker CLI exporter for Sollumz stuff

I made this to quickly export the XML files that Sollumz outputs into the GTA V compatible files that FiveM and CodeWalker use.  

## Usage
Drag and drop the XML file onto the executable. It will output the files in the same directory as the XML file.

## Installation
Just drop it in the same folder as CodeWalker and it'll work.

## Support
You think I'm going to support this shit app? Good joke.
